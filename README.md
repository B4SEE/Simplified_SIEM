## **Overview**  
This project is designed to track user authentication events, store logs, analyze suspicious patterns, and visualize data in a real-time dashboard. It simulates an enterprise-level **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system with a focus on login monitoring.  

**Key functionalities include:**  
- **User authentication system** (registration, login, password reset, etc.)  
- **Log collection & storage** for authentication events  
- **Suspicious activity detection** (brute-force attacks, login anomalies, unusual password resets)  
- **Real-time dashboard** for visualizing logs and alerts
